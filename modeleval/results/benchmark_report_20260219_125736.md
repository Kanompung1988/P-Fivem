## 📝 Notes

### Methodology

- **Test Dataset**: 20 diverse Thai queries (easy, medium, hard)
- **Quality Metric**: Keyword match score (presence of expected keywords)
- **Latency**: End-to-end response time including network
- **Cost**: Calculated from official pricing (input + output tokens)

### Limitations

- Keyword matching is a simple quality metric (doesn't measure semantic correctness)
- Results may vary based on:
  - Network conditions
  - API rate limits
  - Time of day
- Human evaluation recommended for final model selection

### Next Steps

1. Run benchmark with full dataset (20 queries)
2. Perform human evaluation of response quality
3. Test with real user queries from production logs
4. Monitor performance in production environment
5. Set up A/B testing for model comparison
